# SixtyForth

Welcome to SixtyForth, `64th` for short.

SixtyForth a 64-bit implementation of FORTH
written in 64-bit Intel assembler.

The SixtyForth language is inspired by the FORTH-83 standard,
but since it does not follow the standard exactly,
it should probably be more accurately described as
a FORTH-like language.

## Building SixtyForth and running it

Unpack the distribution from the magnetic tape.
Ensure NASM is installed.
Then:

    cd sixtyforth
    make

This creates the executable binary `64th`.

    ./64th
